# Asset Tool Tip Plugin
This plugin allows you to view the name of an asset as you hover over it.

## Install
Currently you need to either follow the build guide down below or use the R2ModMan. 

## Usage
By hovering over an asset's image in an asset browser, a tooltip will provide the asset's current name.
This is compatible with EAR & EAL, but is not required.
