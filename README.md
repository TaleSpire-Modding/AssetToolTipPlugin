# Asset Tool Tip Plugin
[![Nuget Published](https://github.com/TaleSpire-Modding/AssetToolTipPlugin/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TaleSpire-Modding/AssetToolTipPlugin/actions/workflows/release.yml)

This plugin allows you to view the name of an asset as you hover over it.

## Install
Currently you need to use R2ModMan. 
To use in your project, `dotnet add package TaleSpire.AssetToolTip`

## Usage
By hovering over an asset's image in an asset browser, a tooltip will provide the asset's current name.
This is compatible with EAR & EAL, but is not required.
